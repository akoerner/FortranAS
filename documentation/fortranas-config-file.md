# FortranAS.conf
The `FortranAS.conf` configuration file provides a means to change the behavior
of **FortranAS**. All parameters within this file are commented and documented
in the configuration file; review the [FortranAS.conf](../FortranAS.conf) file
for information on configuration parameters.

The `FortranAS.conf` file is expected to be in the current working directory 
before **FortranAS** is started. If it is missing then an
exception will occure.  All configuration parameters are
expected to be defined in this file. If any definitions are
missing then an exception will be thrown relating to 
the missing parameter.
